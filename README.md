# Dissertation Code

This repository contains the code used for my PhD dissertation. Below is a brief overview of the contents and instructions for setting up and running the code.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used in the experiments and must not be modify it, whether manual or external dataset 
- `scripts/`: Includes all the scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `intermediate/`: this contains the datasets product of processing the datasets in the `data/` folder, hence are modifiable.
    - `storage/`: Contains datasets resulting of the datasets in `data/` folder, this datasets are move to the `out/` folder    only when datasets are ready to use it to get results.
    - `out/`: Contains datasets ready to get final results, no additional processing is required (data cleaning)
- `results/`: Output files and results from the experiments.
